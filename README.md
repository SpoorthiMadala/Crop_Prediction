# Crop_Prediction
This project compares two machine learning models — Random Forest and XGBoost — for a classification task. The dataset is processed, evaluated, and optimized using different techniques, including hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. The models' performances are assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualizations.

The goal is to analyze the performance of Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, evaluate them using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation, and generate comprehensive performance reports.
